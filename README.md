# Impact of Social Media on Mental Health

## Introduction
The project explores how social media impacts mental health, a topic that resonates with many in their daily lives. Through **scrollytelling**, the narrative delves into the layered effects of social media, such as increased anxiety, depression, loneliness, and sleep deprivation. The project uses data, research, and visual storytelling to shed light on these issues.

## Themes and Findings

### Key Themes
- **External Validation**: Social media triggers the brain's reward system, leading to dependency similar to gambling.
- **Sleep Deprivation**: Poor sleep caused by excessive screen time weakens cognitive and emotional abilities.
- **Loneliness**: Time spent online replaces meaningful offline interactions, reducing the quality of friendships.

### Research Highlights
- Social media encourages behaviors such as comparing oneself to others, compulsive checking, and a dependency on likes and comments.
- Algorithms and features like endless feeds sustain user engagement, creating a cycle of reliance.
